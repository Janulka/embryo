make an experiment directory that contains embryo configuration file and target pictures.
run embryo-optim with arguments -c for cmaes configuration file and -p for a path to the experiment directory. Use -g switch if you like to save MLP params for each generation.
the output files (best weights of MLP controller) "best.params" and "best.cells.params" will be stored in the current directory. 
the evaluation process is printed to the standard output.

run embryo-view from an experiment directory as e.g.:
../../tools/view/embryo-view -p best.params -s best.cell.params -e embryo.conf -t triangle.pgm

triangle.pgm = twobands45 flag
